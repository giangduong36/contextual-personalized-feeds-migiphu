# A Personalized News Feed

Personalized recommendations are ubiquitous on websites and influence the kind of information we receive.
We were interested in understanding, applying and comparing different recommender systems.
We were particularly interested in contextual bandit, an online-learning algorithm, that adapts to usersâ€™ activities to improve its recommendations.
This project consists of three main components:

+ A personalized news feed built with Django featuring news articles
+ Recommendations were created using: Tf-idf, Doc2Vec, Item-item Collaborative Filtering and an ensemble method using Learning to Rank
+ Contextual bandit recommender was trained as a proof of concept.

### About the data:

Our news feed is built on a
[Facebook dataset](http://www.jbencina.com/blog/2017/07/14/facebook-news-dataset-1000k-comments-20k-posts/) collected
by John Bencina. It contains approximately 20,000 posts from 83 various news sources and a total of 1,000,000 comments from 462,431 users. Following are the fields in each data table:

+ Posts: created time, message, link, number of reactions and shares
+ News pages: name and id of news source
+ Comments: created time, id of parent post, name and id of user, message
